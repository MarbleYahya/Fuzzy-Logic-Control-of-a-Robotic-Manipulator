# Fuzzy-Logic-Control-of-a-Robotic-Manipulator


Computational Intelligence Course Project 

Design and implementation of a fuzzy inference–based controller for autonomous motion, target tracking, and obstacle avoidance of a robotic arm in the Webots simulator using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the application of **Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC)** to robotic manipulation tasks.

A multi-joint manipulator must reach targets, adapt to environmental changes, and avoid collisions.  
Instead of classical model-based control, decision making is performed through **linguistic rules and fuzzy inference**.

The implementation is developed in **Python** and tested inside a physics-based robotic simulation.
